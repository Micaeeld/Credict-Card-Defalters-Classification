# Quick tutorial on how to classify credit card defaulters
This notebook provides a quick guide on how to use machine learning techniques to classify credit card customers as delinquent or non-delinquent. Let's explore the credit history dataset and build a classification model capable of predicting whether a customer will be a debtor or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this tutorial is Kaggle's "Predict Credit Card Defaulters", which contains information about credit card customers such as age, gender, payment history, credit balance, and more. The objective is to predict whether a customer will be a debtor (1) or a non-debtor (0).

## Step by Step

1. **Loading and Exploring the Data**

The first step is to load and explore the data. We will use the "Predict Credit Card Defaulters" dataset, which contains information relevant to our ranking.

2. **Data Pre-processing**

Before building the model, we must clean the data if necessary, removing null values, deleting unnecessary columns, transforming objects into integers... 

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**

We are now ready to build and train our classification model. In this tutorial, we will use Decision Tree Classifier and Extra Trees Classifier as machine learning algorithms.

4. **Interpretation of Results**

After training and evaluating the model, we can interpret the results. Model accuracy on test data indicates the percentage of correct predictions.
